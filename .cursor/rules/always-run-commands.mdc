# Run Commands Without Asking

- When a task requires running a terminal command (e.g. `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm install`, tests, lint, migrations), **run it directly**.
- Do **not** ask the user for permission before running. Just execute the command.
- Use the run_terminal_cmd tool (or equivalent) immediately when the task needs it.
- Only use `request_permissions: network` or similar when the tool actually requires it for the command to succeed.
